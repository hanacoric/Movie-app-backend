# Movie-review-app
Full-stack 2nd semester web development project

General idea:
A web app similar to letterboxd where users can
1.	Search for movies using the external OMDb API.
2.	Save movies they watched
3.	Save movies they want to watch (watchlist)
4.	Write reviews and rate movies
5.	Pick their top 10 favorite movies
My REST API will handle users, reviews and favorite movies, while the OMDb API helps fetch movie data without storing every movie in the database.
